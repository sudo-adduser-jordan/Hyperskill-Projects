<h2>Is it a problem?</h2>
<p>For instance, you have the following pattern <code class="java">r'([Dd]ogs?)|([Cc]ats])'</code>and the following string <code class="java">'Dogs are the best!'</code>. As you can see the string matches only the first group of the regexp pattern. What happens if you pass the <code class="java">groups()</code>method on the result?</p>
