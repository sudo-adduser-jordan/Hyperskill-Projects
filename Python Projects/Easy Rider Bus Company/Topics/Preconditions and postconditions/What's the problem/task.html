<h2>What's the problem?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Some time ago you were asked to write a program that returns a string if there is the <code class="java">@</code> character before it. However, your code raises an error even though it is obvious that the strings match the pattern. Can you correct the code and solve this issue?  </p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">@Jane123</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Jane123</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
