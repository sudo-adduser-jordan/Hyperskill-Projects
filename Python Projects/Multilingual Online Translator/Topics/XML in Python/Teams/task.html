We are sorry for the inconvenience, we will fix this as soon as we can. If you prefer to solve the problem via a different IDE, you should open it manually and then copy the solution to the website.</div><p></p>
<p>A text file you will work with will have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="java">&lt;team name="Snow white"&gt;
    &lt;members&gt;
        &lt;member name="Dopy"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Bashful"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Sneezy"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Sleepy"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Happy"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Grumpy"/&gt;
        &lt;member name="Doc"/&gt;
    &lt;/members&gt;
&lt;/team&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Your task is to extract all team members' names and output them in the same order, separated by spaces. Type the <strong>result</strong> in the text field below. For the example above, the answer would be: <code class="java">Dopy Bashful Sneezy Sleepy Happy Grumpy Doc</code>.</p></body></html><br>
