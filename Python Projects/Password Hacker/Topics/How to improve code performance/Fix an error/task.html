<p>Generators do not return the entire list at once. Instead, they return a list that you can iterate over one by one. The following function should work as a generator. But there is an incorrect line in it. Fix <strong>one</strong> <strong>wrong</strong> <strong>line</strong> in the function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def get_square_root():
    for num in range(1, 100):
        if num % 5 == 0:
            sqrt_num = num ** 0.5
            return sqrt_num</code></pre>
<p>You only need to print one line in the answer field.</p>
