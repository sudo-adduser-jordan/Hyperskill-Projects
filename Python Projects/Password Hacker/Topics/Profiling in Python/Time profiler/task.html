<h2>Time profiler</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We created the <code class="java">catalan</code> function to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Catalan number</a>. We want to see now how long it takes for the program to compute the first 15 Catalan numbers. To do so, we used a For loop that calls our function 15 times. Create a timer around the For loop and save the result in a variable called <code class="java">message</code>. The message is as follows: <code class="java">It took {<em>end - start} </em>seconds</code>.</p>
<p>You don't need to print or return anything, just implement the timer.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
