<h2>Yield from</h2>
<p>Previously, you've learned some basics of generators. Let's revise the most important points. You already know that a generator is declared the same way as a regular function, with a single difference: the <code class="language-python">return</code> keyword gets replaced with <code class="language-python">yield</code>. A generator declares a function that behaves like an iterator and gives you a new value when you ask for it. Due to this, generators are memory-efficient: they only require memory for the one value they yield. Also, <code class="language-python">yield</code> actually saves the state of the function, so that each time you ask the generator to produce a new value, execution continues from where it stopped. Now, it's high time we learned one more useful feature of the keyword <code class="language-python">yield</code>. Let's see how <code class="language-python">yield from</code> works and why it is useful.</p><h5 id="yield-from-expression">Yield from expression </h5><p>Suppose you have the following generator:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def generator():
    for x in range(100):
        yield x
    for y in range(100, 200):
        yield y</code></pre><p>As you can see, this generator yields numbers from 0 to 199. However, what if you need to split it into two generators in order to reuse them later? You can rewrite the code the following way:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def generator2():
    for x in range(100):
        yield x

def generator3():
    for y in range(100, 200):
        yield y

def generator():
    for x in generator2():
        yield x
    for y in generator3():
        yield y</code></pre><p>This <code class="language-python">generator()</code> also yields the numbers from 0 to 199. However, it seems unnecessary and repetitive to iterate over both <code class="language-python">generator2</code> and <code class="language-python">generator3</code> once again and yield their values. That's where <code class="language-python">yield from</code> comes in handy. Let's rewrite the code, using this expression:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def generator():
    yield from generator2()
    yield from generator3()</code></pre><p>This version gives the same result, but the code looks much cleaner and is easier to write and read. In the code above, <code class="language-python">generator()</code> is the <strong>delegating generator</strong>, while <code class="language-python">generator2</code> and <code class="language-python">generator3</code> are called <strong>sub-generators</strong>. So, by using <code class="language-python">yield from</code> you can delegate a part of generator operations to a sub-generator. This allows you to divide the code of the main generator and put a part of it into another one. The syntax is also very easy:</p><pre><code class="language-python">yield from &lt;expr&gt;</code></pre><p>Note that <code class="language-python">&lt;expr&gt;</code> can be any iterable: list, dictionary, another generator, etc.</p><h5 id="why-is-it-useful">Why is it useful?       </h5><p>Basically, you can use <code class="language-python">yield from</code> to make it easier to correctly iterate through and yield values from another iterable.</p><p>For simple iterators, <code class="language-python">yield from</code> is equivalent to a for-loop, but it also contains the full range of generator features and allows generator code to be fractured in an easy and straightforward way.</p><pre><code class="language-python">def gen(iterable):
    for i in list(iterable):
        yield i

# is equivalent to

def gen2(iterable):
    yield from list(iterable)</code></pre><p>When the code execution comes to <code class="language-python">yield from &lt;exp&gt;</code>, the iteration of <code class="language-python">&lt;exp&gt;</code> starts and yielded values are sent to the outer generator right away. It goes on until <code class="language-python">&lt;exp&gt;</code> is exhausted and returns <code class="language-python">StopIteration</code>. After this, the execution of the outer generator continues.</p><p>Let's have a look at one more example that demonstrates this: </p><pre><code class="language-python">def one_more_generator(word):
    yield from word
    print(word)
</code></pre><p>When you call the code above, firstly, <code class="language-python">word</code> will be iterated until the end, and then execution of the outer generator will go on:</p><pre><code class="language-python">for i in one_more_generator('python'):
    print(i)

# output

p
y
t
h
o
n
python</code></pre><p>Thus, the main benefit of using <code class="language-python">yield from &lt;expression&gt;</code> is the opportunity to divide generators into several sub-generators. As a result, <code class="language-python">yield from</code> makes coding easier and more efficient.
